ToDo for DBIx::StORM
--------------------

I've been asked what the major areas of work are to get StORM ready for a v0.9
release. They include:

 - Reworked caching. The information on subroutine compliation, PK/FK lookup
   and similar is well-suited to caching and should be. Preferred column
   caching also needs work.

 - The path lookup with arrow operators needs to be replaced with array refs
   for binary safety.

 - Better division between the code and the SQLDriver.

 - Better implementation of the fake result array, so you can look forwards
   and backwards.

 - Overhaul of the class module.

 - Support for GROUP BY.

 - Ideally, better error handling and better test suite
